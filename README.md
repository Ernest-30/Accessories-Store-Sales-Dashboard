# Accessories-Store-Sales-Dashboard

The Manager of Accessories stores has requested for an Interactive dashboard to capture the overall performance of the store for the year 2018.

The datasets provided were in 2 different excel files; Orders data (6 Columns) and Details data (7 Columns). 

I carried out Data cleaning, manuplation and modelling in excel using; Vlookup to join both datasets,I created additional date columns using the Text and date function, I alsocarried out columns standardization and data formatting.

I aggregated the final dataset into tables using the pivot table function which was used in creating the Dashboard.
